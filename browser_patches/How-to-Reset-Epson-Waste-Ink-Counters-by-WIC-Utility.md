## Tips and warnings

- WIC Reset Utility can only reset the waste ink counters once per reset key. You cannot use the same reset key for multiple printers or multiple times for the same printer.
- WIC Reset Utility is not affiliated with Epson or any other printer manufacturer. Use it at your own risk. We are not responsible for any damage or loss caused by using WIC Reset Utility.
